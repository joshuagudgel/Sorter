# Sorter

The initial goal of project this project is to practice responsible coding practices
through Test Driven Development with common python tools, specifically Python's
unit testing framework "unittest".

Test Driven Development starts with defining requirements in unit tests and then 
writing the minimum amount of code to pass those tests.

A couple benefits of TDD is its scalable and thorough approach to creating
projects when tests can properly confirm functionality. One drawback is the amount of
time it can take when tests are not guarenteed to have complete coverage. 

Tests are ran with the command: 
python test_sorter.py
