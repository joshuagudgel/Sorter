Sorter - A starter project for trying Test Driven Development

The initial goal of project this project is to practice responsible coding practices through Test Driven Development with common python tools, specifically with pytest.

Test Driven Development starts with defining requirements in unit tests and then writing the minimum amount of code to pass those tests.

A couple benefits of TDD is its scalable and thorough approach to creating projects when tests can properly confirm functionality. One drawback is the amount of time it can take when tests are not guarenteed to have complete coverage. 


Setup

Install pytest
pip install -U pytest

Tests are ran in the project directory with the following command:
